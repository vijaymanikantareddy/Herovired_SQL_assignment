Question 1:  Find Count, Min, Max and Average values from the given array -

Skill Mapping: Basic


Description: Consider an array with N number of multiple integers. Find below values - 

The element with the Minimum value 

The element with the Maximum value 

Average of all array elements

Total number of array elements (Count).


Sample input : arrNum = {31, 42, 25, 21, 56,  61, 13, 45, 76, 55}

Output : The element with the Minimum value: 13

The element with the Maximum value: 76

Average of all array elements: 42

Total number of array elements: 10


Question 2:   Reverse the Array elements

Skill Mapping: Basic


Description: WAP in Java to print all the array elements in reverse order.


Sample input : arrNum = {31, 42, 25, 21, 56,  61, 13, 45, 76, 55}

Output : The elements in reverse order - 

55, 76, 45, 13, 61, 56, 21, 25, 42, 31

Question 3: Sort the Array elements in ascending order and descending order

Skill Mapping: Basic


Description: WAP in Java to print all the array elements in ascending order and in descending order.


Sample input : arrNum = {23, 21, 44, 32, 12}

Output : The elements in ascending order: 12, 21, 23, 32, 44

The elements in descending order: 44, 32, 23, 21, 12


Question 4:   Find the largest Prime number in given Array 

Skill Mapping: Basic


Description: WAP in Java to print the Largest Prime number from the given array of integer numbers.

Sample input : arrNum = {2, 29, 51, 8, 4}

Output : The Largest Prime number in given array: 29 


Question 5:   Move all the ones at the end of an Array 

Skill Mapping: Basic


Description: WAP in Java to shift all the array elements having value as one to the end of an array.

Sample input : arrNum = {3, 1, 4, 1, 2, 1, 8, 3, 2, 1}

Output : Array elements after moving Ones to end: 3, 4, 2, 8, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1


Question 6:   Find how many elements from Array A are present in the other Array B. and Print their frequencies.

Skill Mapping: Basic


Description: Consider a subset Array-A with N number of elements. And another Array-B with N number of elements. 

Sample input : arrSuperSet = {3, 1, 3, 4, 1, 2, 1, 8, 3, 2, 1, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3, 4}

arrSubSet = {1, 2, 3, 5, 9}

Output : Frequency of 1: 5

Frequency of 2: 3

Frequency of 3: 6 

Frequency of 5: 0

Frequency of 9: 0
